// 1. Read input.txt and fill two vectors with the numbers from each line
//    (first number to left, second to right)

// 2. For each number in the left vector, count how many times it appears in the right vector

// 3. For each such number, multiply the left number by its count in the right vector

// 4. Sum all these products to get the similarity score

// 5. Output the similarity score

// 6. (Optional) Optimize counting with a hash map for the right vector
